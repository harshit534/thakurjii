	<p>
		The development of a website includes both its initial design and subsequent upkeep. It refers to the efforts put across the scenes to ensure a website looks nice, runs well, and provides a pleasant experience for visitors.

		For instance, when you see a button called “Checkout Now,” many website users do not even give much attention to the code that takes them to the transaction gateway. Web development companies are responsible for the look and functionality of the button and the website as a whole.

		However, there are many types of web development and developers based on the subject. First, we’ll take a look at the various types of web development approaches so you can make an informed choice around your interest.
	</p>
	<h2>What are The Different Types of Web Development?</h2>
	<p>
		It is essential to first grasp the three primary forms of web development before diving into the practice of web development itself and talk about the many kinds and technologies that go along with them. <br> 

		1. Front-End Development <br>
		2. Back-End Development <br>
		3. Full-Stack Development <br>
		Let’s examine each category separately.
	</p>
	<h2>1. Front-End Web Development</h2>
	<p>
		Client-side web development, or front-end web development, is another name for this process. It’s the practice of creating a website’s front end using markup languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

		When designing the front end of a website, the goal should be to ensure that all material can be read without any difficulty by the target audience. Front-end developers and web designers must also be proficient at writing tidy and effective code in order to create an interface that is both visually appealing and functional.

		Most common Programming Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries in Front-End Development
	</p>
	<h2>1.1 HTML</h2>
	<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQEc9A_S6BPxCDRp5WjMFEfXrpCu1ya2OO-Lw&s" alt="">
	<p>Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML for short, is a programming language for making websites and web applications. Let’s define HTML and a web page and discover what they mean.

		HyperText refers to a text that has embedded links. Each time you use a search engine to find information online and then click on a link that takes you to another website, you are using hypertext. When you use HyperText, you may connect any number of individual web pages (HTML documents) to one another.
		Markup languages are computer languages to apply standard layout and formatting rules to text documents. Dynamic and engaging content is possible using markup languages. The program has the ability to transform plain text into graphics, tables, hyperlinks, and more.
		A webpage is a document created in the hypertext markup language (HTML) and read by a web browser. Just typing in a website’s address (or “URL”) will take you to that page. There are two distinct types of websites: static and dynamic. Static web pages may be made with just HTML.
	So, HTML is a markup language used to create visually appealing web pages by employing various forms of style, and which display appropriately on a web browser. Different information is contained in each of the numerous HTML tags that make up an HTML page.</p>
	<h2>2. CSS</h2>
	<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRvyarc5ql5Qb0aUtE9MLaAapWxWpH8kXp0GA&s" alt="">
	<p>CSS is an abbreviation for cascading style sheets. This is the language used to create a website’s design and structure. CSS is as essential as HTML for building websites. Websites would still just be sober text on a plain background if it wasn’t around.

		Until the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed cascading style sheets (CSS) in 1996, the appearance and functionality of Web sites were severely constrained. Hypertext was the original format for web pages, which early browsers displayed as plain text with pictures and links to other hypertext sites. Paragraphs were just strewn throughout the page in a single column with no real arrangement at all.

		With CSS you can do things like:

		.   Alter the browser’s default typefaces, change the text and link colors, and adjust their sizes.
		.   Use colors in backdrop design
	.   Frame website components in boxes and reposition them wherever on the page using the “float” feature.</p>
	<h2>3. JavaScript</h2>
	<img src="https://jbstechinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/JavaScript-Symbol.png" alt="">
	<p>JavaScript is a simple, translated programming language used to enhance and add functionality to websites. It’s versatile enough to be used for everything from adding new buttons to creating complex animations. JavaScript extends the functionality of the browser by following basic instructions embedded within script> tags in an HTML document.

		When JavaScript is set on a computer, it’s simple to make changes to existing web sites or build whole new ones from the start. Web developers frequently choose JavaScript due to widespread browser support.

	In order to increase the amount of time visitors spend on your site, JavaScript must be used. If you have Gmail running and click the inbox tab, for instance, rather than the full website loading, you will see a seamless movement, and the inbox will populate.</p>
	<h2>4. Angular</h2>
	<img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.knoldus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/angular-logo-1.png?fit=480%2C240&ssl=1" alt="">
	<p>When it comes to web frontend frameworks, Angular is by far the most popular option. A framework for developing highly functional and feature-rich single-page programs. It’s a Google-made programming environment that relies on Typescript. Angular is a series of tools for creating, building, testing, and modifying code, as well as a library of well-integrated libraries, all geared toward the creation of large online applications.

		Depending on your requirements, Angular may help you build a single-page app or an enterprise-level solution. There are now two major users: YouTube and Google Translate. With its many useful features, it has quickly become among the most widely used frameworks available.

	</p>
	<h2>5. React</h2>
	<img src="https://www.fullstackpython.com/img/logos/react.png" alt="">
	<p>React, or ReactJS as it is more often referred, is a popular front-end JavaScript toolkit for creating user interfaces and associated components. It is built using MVC, but with a new data presentation and accessibility matrix. The Virtual DOM and its approach to document access and modification are two of its defining characteristics. As a result of the DOM’s interactions with HTML and XML documents, the latter take on a tree-like structure, with each HTML element acting as an object.

	React, developed by Facebook, is widely regarded as an excellent front-end library. To build its parts, JSX employs a syntax that combines HTML tags and quotation marks. It disassembles complex systems into simpler parts that may be handled independently. While using this function, developers will naturally become more efficient.</p>
	<h2>6. Backbone.js</h2>
	<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSVBCJvS11fZiBuRo17WNcTBasGBYp4m6Dj0A&s" alt="">
	<p>Backbone, first published in 2010, is a simple and compact front-end framework. It’s meant for creating single-page applications and is based on the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) syntax. Backbone.js is a popular JavaScript library that offers frameworks with custom actions and substantial key-value binding, giving web applications the structure they need. Libraries of enhanced APIs exist, including features like functions, declarative event handling, and views. It has a RESTful JSON interface, so it can talk to the existing API without any problems. 

	This language is perfect for developing unified, single-page web applications. With the Backbone Layout Manager, programmers have access to a library of pre-made viewpoints. For problem-solving and communication, as well as in places with plenty of code, it has been deemed beneficial. It’s a simple fix for a complex issue.</p>
	<h2>7. Ember.js</h2>
	<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTzSLNCPPSTKkivcY1p_3WOUYTjwL9HMJgoQw&s" alt="">
	<p>Since 2011, developers have had access to the Ember.js frontend framework. Aspiring web developers leverage Ember to create robust cross-platform projects, despite the fact that it is not as popular as other frameworks. It would be another open-source option worth watching. It may help you create cutting-edge UIs for web-based software, mobile and desktop apps, and even cross-platform software.

	The MVVM architecture is used here. As a default, Ember creates a testing program for every new object. The Ember audience is always growing, and this means that you can always count on cutting-edge programmers to add and refine the framework’s existing capabilities.</p>
	<h2>8. Semantic-UI</h2>
	<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:380/1*fitaZfN6E6m3stD_W_TubA.png" alt="">
	<p>Semantic-UI is a web design framework that allows you to make sites that look great on all devices. It’s always being updated and expanded upon in order to better serve its users. So, it’s a viable alternative to the popular Bootstrap framework. 

	The concept of a semantic user interface has only been around for a short while. It’s widely recognized as a top frontend framework for building websites. The success is due to the user interface’s readability, ease of use, and spontaneity. Being written in a very straightforward programming language, it is accessible even to newcomers. It’s a great development platform since the process for creating websites and apps is simple, and it works with a number of different third-party libraries.</p>
	<h2>9. Svelte</h2>
	<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1619358925225/50e2XssdE.png?w=1600&h=840&fit=crop&crop=entropy&auto=compress,format&format=webp" alt="">
	<p>This framework is a relative newcomer to the field of frontend development, having had its original launch in 2016, and its steady release occurring in the fall of 2021. In spite of its maturity, Svelte merits consideration as a viable option for creating innovative user interfaces.

	Svelte’s key difference from other frameworks is that its work is done not in the browser but rather in the compiler during the construction process. Because of this, a virtual DOM is unnecessary, and just the elements necessary to render your app need to be uploaded to the page.</p>
	<h2>10. Vue</h2>
	<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/1*CPDIH8BWrGipHRJ6o6E2Vw.png" alt="">
	<p>Vue.js is a cutting-edge, forward-thinking MVVM framework that makes excellent use of gradual adoption. Being one of the top JavaScript libraries, Vue.js has been developing compact, flexible, and interactive UI components. It offers data-reactive components with an adaptable and user-friendly application programming interface. Little tasks are easy to finish and may be scaled up to bigger ones with little difficulty.

	Vue.js’s compact size makes it easy to download and set up. It’s possible to make both basic and complex templates, and mistakes may be spotted immediately. Integration with third-party apps is made easier, and comprehensive documentation is provided. It also helps programmers learn about other similar front-end frameworks, such as Angular.js, React.js, and others. Because of its Model-View-Viewmodel design, working with HTML components is simplified.</p>
	<h2>11. Preact</h2>
	<img src="https://muhimasri.com/static/432ec299518c2509cf9b6a6e1187e662/be4c9/preact.webp" alt="">
	<p>Although React is the most widely used front-end framework, it is not without flaws. It was for these reasons that the concept of creating a lightweight framework with the same capabilities as React emerged. This is how Preact, a very condensed form of React, came into being.

	Both Preact and React are based on the same API and follow the same app development practices. Preact, on the other hand, is far more compact and makes use of the most lightweight and speedy virtual DOM implementation imaginable.</p>
	<h2>2. Back-End Web Development</h2>
	<p>Backend development, or server-side web development, is the process of creating a website’s infrastructure. Back-end developers are responsible for the conceptual framework of a website and the coding that supports it. The logic, databases, servers, and APIs on the back-end are the primary areas of interest.

		Because the back-end handles the heavy lifting in a web project, the technology that goes into making a site is often hidden from view. Therefore back-end web development is an integral component of every website.

		PHP is a popular server-side scripting language that may be used to create interactive web content and track user sessions as well as administer databases and online stores.

	Commonly employed programming languages and frameworks in Back-end Development</p>

	<p>Django, a Python framework, was introduced in 2005 and quickly rose to prominence. It’s a top-tier, open-source framework that has everything a programmer may need, including scalability and personalization. Django is built on the MVC pattern and the DRY coding concept, both of which emphasize code reuse to improve Django’s speed and efficiency. The JSON, XML, and HTML markup languages are all supported by this framework. 

	It’s primary usage is in the construction of online applications in a short amount of time; it employs well-known Python capabilities and provides an interface for managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) tasks. Among the most well-known websites and apps that make use of Django are those from Google, YouTube, Instagram, Spotify, Pinterest, DropBox, Mozilla, and National Geographic.</p>
	<h2>6. Laravel</h2>
	<img src="https://picperf.io/https://laravelnews.s3.amazonaws.com/images/laravel-featured.png" alt="">
	<p>Laravel is a PHP framework that was introduced in 2011 and is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It has a user-friendly interface and is backed by a comprehensive library and API. Its primary function is the creation of websites, such as blogs, online shops, and news sources. With Laravel, programmers can build incredible, bespoke web applications with the aid of PHP’s expressive and beautiful syntax and database utilities like ORM (Object Relational Mapper).

	Additionally, local or cloud-based email application sending speeds are much improved. Laravel is often compared to Ruby on Rails and Django since it uses MVC architecture for website development like both of those frameworks and is scalable and secure like Ruby on Rails. It is an end-to-end framework for processing data on the server side. Some notable businesses, including 9GAG, Pfizer, Crowdcube, and Razorpay, have used Laravel as their backend framework.</p>
	<h2>7. Express</h2>

It’s compatible with the three major operating systems. Slack, SpaceX, Alibaba Travel, and MasterCard are just a few of the companies embracing ASP.NET as their server-side framework of choice.</p>
	<h2>3. Full-Stack Web Development</h2>
	<p>Creating both the front and back ends of a website is known as “full-stack web development.” A full-stack developer is one that is well-versed in all aspects of creating and maintaining websites, from design, coding, databases to fixing bugs.

		The skillset of full-stack developers includes not just client-side and server-side web application development but also database administration. When it comes to revamping, creating, and accelerating the complete website designing and construction process, full-stack web developers know what they’re doing.

		Full-stack web developers must also keep an eye out for emerging technologies and frameworks in the field, such as blockchain, deep learning, and multi-cloud, to use in their projects.

	Commonly Employed Stacks in Full-Stack Web Development</p>
	<h2>1. MEAN</h2>
	<img src="https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/trt-blog-ghost/2023/01/Mean-Tech-stack.png" alt="">
	<p>MEAN is a popular technology stack because it offers several advantages to web developers. The usage of a single language (JavaScript) and the availability of free, open-source technology are two of the advantages. What makes up MEAN are:<br>

		<h1>.</h1>   MongoDB (NoSQL database) (NoSQL database).<br>
		<h1>.</h1>  Use of the Express.js web framework for the back end. <br>
		<h1>.</h1>  An HTML5 and JSX front-end framework called Angular. <br>
		<h1>.</h1>  Node.js server-side JavaScript. <br>
	With MEAN, you can create apps that are both quick and powerful. The components may exchange data via the JavaScript Object Notations (JSON) language, and they have access to a vast, open-source library of modules. This technology stack is useful for creating highly scalable software. It works well for any sort of dynamic web page or program.</p>
	<h2>2. MERN</h2>
	<img src="https://www.rlogical.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MERN.webp" alt="">
	<p>Simply said, MERN is just like MEAN but with a different name. Swapping out Angular.js with React is the main difference.

		The main reasons to use MERN are the full-stack development alternative, the React integration, the strong library, and the possibility to utilize code on browsers and servers concurrently (frontend and backend).

	In particular, React is well-known for its speed and adaptability in creating interactive user interfaces.</p>
	<h3 class="h3">FUTURE READING ON:</h3><h3 class="container">MEAN STACK VS MERN STACK</h3>
